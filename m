QEMU's linux-user mode always only runs the single process,
which is a fixed guest architecture. But it also wants to
make system calls on its own behalf, as well as the ones it
is passing through from the guest, and I suspect it would
confuse the host libc if we changed the semantics of those
under its feet.

The first of those is not sufficient for QEMU if done
as a per-architecture thing, because there may not even be
a 32-bit syscall interface on the host kernel. The second
sounds better -- there's nothing conceptually architecture
specific about what we want to do or which is tied to the
idea of whether there's a 32-bit compat mode in the host
architecture or not.
