There might be multiple issues present and I'm having difficulty
reliably doing any kind of regression testing here, but I think this
patch helps fix at least one of the issues I was seeing that occurs
specifically during early boot. It may fix other hangs.

Title:
  Issue with qemu 2.12.0 + SATA

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  [EDIT: I first thought that OVMF was the issue, but it turns out to be
  SATA]

  I had a Windows 10 VM running perfectly fine with a SATA drive, since
  I upgraded to qemu 2.12, the guests hangs for a couple of minutes,
  works for a few seconds, and hangs again, etc. By "hang" I mean it
  doesn't freeze, but it looks like it's waiting on IO or something, I
  can move the mouse but everything needing disk access is unresponsive.

  What doesn't work: qemu 2.12 with SATA
  What works: using VirIO-SCSI with qemu 2.12 or downgrading qemu to 2.11.1=
 and keep using SATA.

  Platform is arch linux 4.16.7 on skylake and Haswell, I have attached
  the vm xml file.
