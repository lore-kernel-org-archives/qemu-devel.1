Hi Maxim,

No I didn't...

Title:
  9pfs does not honor open file handles on unlinked files

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress
Status in Ubuntu:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  This was originally filed over here:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1114221

  The open-unlink-fstat idiom used in some places to create an anonymous
  private temporary file does not work in a QEMU guest over a virtio-9p
  filesystem.

  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

  qemu-kvm-1.6.2-6.fc20.x86_64
  qemu-system-x86-1.6.2-6.fc20.x86_64
  (those are fedora RPMs)

  How reproducible:

  Always. See this example C program:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=3D913069

  Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Export a filesystem with virt-manager for the guest.
        (type: mount, driver: default, mode: passthrough)
  2. Start guest and mount that filesystem
        (mount -t 9p -o trans=3Dvirtio,version=3D9p2000.L  ...)
  3. Run a program that uses open-unlink-fstat
        (in my case it was trying to compile Perl 5.20)

  Actual results:

  fstat fails:

  open("/home/tst/filename", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600) =3D 3
  unlink("/home/tst/filename")            =3D 0
  fstat(3, 0x23aa1a8)                     =3D -1 ENOENT (No such file or di=
rectory)
  close(3)

  Expected results:

  open("/home/tst/filename", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600) =3D 3
  unlink("/home/tst/filename")            =3D 0
  fstat(3, {st_mode=3DS_IFREG|0600, st_size=3D0, ...}) =3D 0
  fcntl(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           =3D 0
  close(3) =


  Additional info:

  There was a patch put into the kernel back in '07 to handle this very
  problem for other filesystems; maybe its helpful:

        http://lwn.net/Articles/251228/

  There is also a thread on LKML from last December specifically about
  this very problem:

        https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/31/163

  There was a discussion on the QEMU list back in '11 that doesn't seem
  to have come to a conclusion, but did provide the test program that
  i've attached to this report:

        http://marc.info/?l=3Dqemu-devel&m=3D130443605720648&w=3D2
