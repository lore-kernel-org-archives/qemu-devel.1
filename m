Proposed patch at https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1022092/

NB: my guess is that your pwrite on 32-bit arm test is behaving like
that because it isn't going via the pwrite64 syscall, or possibly
because glibc there is dealing with the NULL special case early. Use
QEMU's -strace argument (or strace on real h/w) to see what libc is
actually turning that pwrite() function call into at the syscall level.

Title:
  aarch64-linux-user master: inconsistent pwrite behaviour

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  Hello,

  I am running aarch64-linux-user from master, commit
  20d6c7312f1b812bb9c750f4087f69ac8485cc90

  And I've found the following inconsistent emulation of pwrite() call when=
 buf=3D=3DNULL and len=3D0.
  Minimal reproducible sample is the following:

  #define _GNU_SOURCE
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <string.h>

  /*
  =C2=A0System                  | Result
  -------------------------+----------------
  =C2=A0Native x86_64 4.12.14   | pwrite ret =3D 0
  =C2=A0Native aarch64 4.4.159  | pwrite ret =3D 0
  =C2=A0qemu-aarch64 at x86_64  | pwrite ret =3D -1
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0( 20d6c7312f1b8 )     |
  */

  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  =C2=A0int fd =3D open("test.dat", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0644);
  =C2=A0if (fd < 0) {
  =C2=A0=C2=A0perror("open");
  =C2=A0=C2=A0return 1;
  =C2=A0}

  =C2=A0int ret =3D fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 1000);
  =C2=A0if (ret < 0) {
  =C2=A0=C2=A0perror("fallocate");
  =C2=A0=C2=A0return 1;
  =C2=A0}

  =C2=A0ssize_t ret_pwrite =3D pwrite(fd, NULL, 0, 0);
  =C2=A0printf("pwrite ret =3D %ld\n", ret_pwrite);

  =C2=A0close(fd);

  =C2=A0return 0;
  }

  Please note, that the same binary executable prints different output at n=
ative aarch64 platform and under aarch64-linux-user
