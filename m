Title:
  qemu-img convert a overlay qcow2 image into a entire image

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I have a base image file "base.qcow2" and a delta qcow2 image file
  "delta.qcow2" whose backing file is "base.qcow2".

  Now I use qemu-img to convert "delta.qcow2" and will get a new image
  file "new.qcow2" which is entire and equivalent to combination of
  "base.qcow2" and "delta.qcow2".

  In fact,I don't want to get a complete image.I just want to convert
  delta qcow2 image file "A" to a New delta overlay qcow2 image "B"
  which is equivalent to "A". So the "new.qcow2" is not what i want. I
  have to admit that this is not bug. Could you please take this as a
  new feature and enable qemu-img to convert qcow2 overlay itself?
