Title:
  Passes through prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, address)

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Fix Committed
Status in qemu package in Debian:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  qemu-user passes through prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER,
  address) unmodified, but the third argument is an address to a BPF
  filter, causing an EFAULT. Now, the filter is architecture-specifc, so
  you can't just rewrite the addresses, so the safest bet is to just
  return an error here.

  I guess you should just return EINVAL, but not sure. I'd really like
  something that can be identified, so seccomp errors can be ignored
  when it's not supported.
