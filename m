So at what point do we draw the line?

We're allowing writable DAX mappings, but as I've pointed out that
means we are going to be allowing  a potential information leak via
files with shared extents to be directly mapped and written to.

But we won't allow useful admin operations that allow better
management of host side storage space similar to how normal image
files are used by guests because it's an information leak vector?

That's splitting some really fine hairs there...

"if"?

I expect it to be "when", not if. Expect the worst, plan for it now.

Cheers,
