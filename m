Because of lacking zero chunk table, reading zero sector will return EIO.
I have submitted a series to fix this problem.

Please refer to this series: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-
devel/2018-12/msg05637.html

Thanks,

Title:
  qemu-img convert is freezing for some DMG files.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Recently, I created a file using hdiutil from MacOS (using Zlib
  compression):

  $ hdiutil create -volname MyVolName -srcfolder /path/to/my/vol/ -ov
  -format UDZO myvolname.dmg

  But, when I try to convert this volume using qemu-img convert, this
  command is freezing.

  I'm using the upstream version to test it.

  It is freezing inside the binary search method to retrieve the chunk.

  But, I still don't know why.

  I'm attaching the file as an example.

  It can be mounted using MacOS or other Linux apps like hfsleuth and
  darling-dmg.
