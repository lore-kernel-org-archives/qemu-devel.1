I'd say X corresponds to number of logical CPUs.
Depending on presence of other options these are distributed among them in =
magical manner
(see pc_smp_parse() for starters)

it matches -smp X as it should be.

Title:
  AMD CPUID leaf 0x8000'0008 reported number of cores  inconsistent with
  ACPI.MADT

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Setup:
  CPU: AMD EPYC-v2 or host's EPYC cpu
  Linux 64-bit fedora host; Kernel version 5.5.15-200.fc31

  Issue:
  We are developing an microkernel operating system called L4Re. We recentl=
y got an AMD EPYC server for testing and we couldn't execute SMP tests of o=
ur system when running Linux + qemu + VM w/ L4Re.
  In fact, the kernel did not recognize any APs at all. On AMD CPUs the ker=
nel checks for the number of cores reported in CPUID leaf 0x8000_0008.ECX[N=
C] or [ApicIdSize].  [0][1]

  The physical machine reports for leaf 0x8000_0008:  EAX: 0x3030 EBX: 0x18=
cf757 ECX: 0x703f EDX: 0x1000
  The lower four bits of ECX are the [NC] field and all set.

  When querying inside qemu with -enable-kvm -cpu host -smp 4 (basically as=
 replacement and addition to the above cmdline) the CPUID leaf shows: EAX: =
0x3024, EBX: 0x1001000, ECX: 0x0, EDX: 0x0
  Note, ECX is zero. Indicating that this is no SMP capabale CPU.

  I'm debugging it using my local machine and the QEMU provided EPYC-v2
  CPU model and it is reproducible there as well and reports:  EAX:
  0x3028, EBX: 0x0, ECX: 0x0, EDX: 0x0

  I checked other AMD based CPU models (phenom, opteron_g3/g5) and they beh=
ave the same. [2] shows the CPUID 0x8000'0008 handling in the QEMU source.
  I believe that behavior here is wrong as ECX[NC] should report the number=
 of cores per processor, as stated in the AMD manual [2] p.584. In my under=
standing -smp 4 should then lead to ECX[NC] =3D 0x3.

  The following table shows my findings with the -smp option:
  Option | Qemu guest observed ECX value
  -smp 4 | 0x0
  -smp 4,cores=3D4  | 0x3
  -smp 4,cores=3D2,thread=3D2 | 0x3
  -smp 4,cores=3D4,threads=3D2 | QEMU boot error: topology false.

  Now, I'm asking myself how the terminology of the AMD manual maps to QEMU=
's -smp option.
  Obviously, nr_cores and nr_threads correspond to the cores and threads op=
tions on the cmdline and cores * threads <=3D 4 (in this example), but what=
 corresponds the X in -smp X to?

  Querying 0x8000'0008 on the physical processor results in different
  reports than quering QEMU's model as does it with -enable-kvm -cpu
  host.

  Furthermore, the ACPI.MADT shows 4 local APICs to be present while the
  CPU leave reports a single core processor.

  This leads me to the conclusion that CPUID 0x8000'0008.ECX reports the
  wrong number.
