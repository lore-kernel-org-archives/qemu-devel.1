Title:
  madvise reports success, but doesn't implement WIPEONFORK.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The implementation of madvise (linux-user/syscall.c:11331, tag
  v5.0.0-rc4) always returns zero (i.e. success). However, an
  application requesting (at least) MADV_WIPEONFORK may need to know
  whether the call was actually successful. If not (because the kernel
  doesn't support WIPEONFORK) then it will need to take other measures
  to provide fork-safety (such as drawing entropy from the kernel in
  every case). But, if the application believes that WIPEONFORK is
  supported (because madvise returned zero), but it actually isn't (as
  in qemu), then it may forego those protections on the assumption that
  WIPEONFORK will provide fork-safety.

  Roughly, the comment in qemu that says "This is a hint, so ignoring
  and returning success is ok." is no longer accurate in the presence of
  MADV_WIPEONFORK.

  (This is not purely academic: BoringSSL is planning on acting in this
  way. We found the qemu behaviour in pre-release testing and are
  planning on making an madvise call with advice=3D-1 first to test
  whether unknown advice values actually produce EINVAL.)
