In our multipath case, the initial open succeeds (it's not locked by
anything else) and the second lock attempt fails, however, IIUC the
fcntl structure[1] includes the locking pid, which should be our
invocation of QEMU;

Can we not check if the locking pid matches the current pid and not
fail?  This appears to be the original goal of protecting locked images
from being manipulated by external processes.

Title:
  qemu 2.10 locks images with no feature flag

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  1) % lsb_release -rd
  Description:	Ubuntu Artful Aardvark (development branch)
  Release:	17.10

  2) % apt-cache policy qemu-system-x86
  qemu-system-x86:
    Installed: 1:2.10~rc3+dfsg-0ubuntu1
    Candidate: 1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1
    Version table:

          500 http://archive.ubuntu.com//ubuntu devel/main amd64 Packages
   *** 1:2.10~rc3+dfsg-0ubuntu1 100
          100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

  3) qemu locks image files with no way to discover this feature nor how
  to disable it

  4) qemu provides a way to query if it supports image locking, and what
  the default value is, and how to disable the locking via cli

  qemu 2.10 now will lock image files and warn if an image is currently
  locked.  This prevent qemu from running (and possibly corrupting said
  image).

  However, qemu does not provide any way to determine if a qemu binary
  actually has this capability.  Normally behavior changing features are
  exposed via some change to the qemu help menu or QMP/QAPI output of
  capabilities.

  I believe this slipped through since libvirt already does image
  locking, but direct cli users will be caught by this change.

  In particular, we have a use-case where we simulate multipath disks by
  creating to disks which point to the same file which now breaks
  without adding the 'file.locking=3Doff' to the -drive parameters;  which
  is also completely undocumented and unexposed.

  Some parts of the cli like -device allow querying of settable options
  (qemu-system-x86 -device scsi_hd,?)  but nothing equivalent exists for
  -drive parameters.
