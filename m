+1, just a different way to access that cache.

Conceptually a virtio-pmem devices is from the guest view a "device with
a managed buffer". Some accesses might be faster than others. There are
no guarantees on how fast a certain access is. And yes, actions on other
guests can result in accesses being slower but not faster.

Also other storage devices have caches like that (well, the caches size
depends on the device) - thinking especially about storage systems -
which would in my opinion, also allow similar leaks. How are such
security concerns handled there? Are they different (besides eventually
access speed)?

This sounds very use-case specific. If I run a VM only with a very
specific workload (say, a container running one application), I usually
don't care about leaks within the VM. At least not leaks between
applications ;)

In contrast, to running different applications (e.g. containers from
different customers) on one system, I really care about leaks within a VM=
.

I also want to note that using a disk/file as memory backend with
NVDIMMs in QEMU essentially results in the exact same questions we have
with virtio-pmem.

E.g. kata-containers use nvdimms for the rootfile system (read-only) as
far as I am aware.

Conceptually, a virtio-pmem device is just an emulated nvdimm device
with a flush interface. And the nice thing is, that it is designed to
also work on architectures that don't speak "nvdimm".

I guess configuration and use case.

Nice summary, thanks for looking into this Michael!
