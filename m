I was able to reproduce this with:

qemu - v2.12.0-813-g5a5c383
host/guest kernel - 4.11
libvirt - 3.9.0

It bisects to:

  36c2f8b migration: Delay start of migration main routines


However, the issue did *not* reproduce with:

qemu - v2.12.0-865-ge609fa7
host/guest kernel - 4.11
libvirt - 3.9.0

As Peter suggested, it is fixed by:

  0efc914 migration: fix exec/fd migrations


So perhaps there is still something on libvirt side? I'll try again with a =
more
recent one.
