I tried the above patches on a TR 1900X and they do not help to enable
SMT. I still receive the warning.

Also, with the patches applied, the CPU now identifies as EPYC in the
guest.

Title:
  SMT not supported by QEMU on AMD Ryzen CPU

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  HyperThreading/SMT is supported by AMD Ryzen CPUs but results in this
  message when setting the topology to threads=3D2:

  qemu-system-x86_64: AMD CPU doesn't support hyperthreading. Please
  configure -smp options properly.

  Checking in a Windows 10 guest reveals that SMT is not enabled, and
  from what I understand, QEMU converts the topology from threads to
  cores internally on AMD CPUs. This appears to cause performance
  problems in the guest perhaps because programs are assuming that these
  threads are actual cores.

  Software: Linux 4.12, qemu 2.9.0 host with KVM enabled, Windows 10 pro
  guest
