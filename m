Hello,

I confirm the same problem on Fedora 27 Server using Source code release
2.11.0

The problem remains no matter if I use the "-k en-us" parameter or not.

Worked fine up to 2.10.1

If the guess is Windows, then when trying to type the "<" character then
the pipe ("|") appears.

If the guess is Linux, the same key produces the ">" character.

Both operating systems use the US English keyboard layout.

Thanks a lot for your time and help.

Miguel

Title:
  'Less than' (<), 'more than' (>), and 'pipe' (|) can't be typed via
  VNC

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  If I start QEMU 2.11 (from
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization/qemu) VM with
  VNC, I am unable to type following three characters: 'less than' (<),
  'more than' (>), and 'pipe' (|) on en_US QWERTY keyboard. Other
  characters work fine. QEMu version 2.10.1 worked fine.

  /usr/bin/qemu-kvm -m 2048 -cpu kvm64 -drive
  media=3Dcdrom,if=3Dnone,id=3Dcd0,format=3Draw,file=3DOI-hipster-
  minimal-20171031.iso -device ide-cd,drive=3Dcd0 -boot once=3Dd,menu=3Don
  ,splash-time=3D5000 -device usb-ehci -device usb-tablet -smp 1 -enable-
  kvm -vnc :91,share=3Dforce-shared

  The ISO can be downloaded here: https://www.openindiana.org/download/

  Also tried Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-25-1.3.iso and it's the same
  situation.

  If I run the same command without '-vnc :91,share=3Dforce-shared',
  everything works just fine.
