@elmarco could you take a look at this possible regression since bisect
claims it was due to the mux refactor

Title:
  Ctrl-A b not working in 2.8.0

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  With a recent update from 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 I have discovered that I can
  no longer send a "break" to the VM.  Ctrl-A b is simply ignored.
  Other Ctrl-A sequences seem to work correctly.

  This is on a NetBSD amd64 system, version 7.99.53, and qemu was
  installed on this system from source.

  Reverting to the previous install restores "break" capability.
