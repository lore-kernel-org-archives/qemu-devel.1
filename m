The original code used a union.  It generates the same assembler all the
same.

Title:
  POWER8: Wrong behaviour with float-to-int punning

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Building a reduced test program with 'gcc -O2 -fno-inline
  -mcpu=3Dpower8' produces wrong results at runtime. I don't think gcc is
  at fault here.

  ---
  #include <stdio.h>

  int getWord(const float x)
  {
    return *(int*)&x;
  }

  void main()
  {
      int foo =3D getWord(+123.456f);
      int bar =3D getWord(-123.456f);

      printf("%d\n", foo);
      printf("%d\n", bar);
      return;
  }
  ---

  This prints:
  ---
  0
  0
  ---

  Compiling with 'gcc -O2 -fno-inline -mcpu=3Dpower7' and you instead get t=
he expected result:
  ---
  1123477881
  -1024005767

  The different between the two programs is:

  --- power7.s

  Seems like qemu doesn't handle xscvdpspn/mfvsrwz correctly.
