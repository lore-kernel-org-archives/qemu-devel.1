I am working on testing instruction emulation patches for the linux
kernel. During testing I found these 2 issues:

 - sets DSX (delay slot exception) but never clears it
 - EEAR for illegal insns should point to the bad exception (as per
   openrisc spec) but its not

This patch fixes these two issues by clearing the DSX flag when not in a
delay slot and by setting EEAR to exception PC when handling illegal
instruction exceptions.

After this patch the openrisc kernel with latest patches boots great on
qemu and instruction emulation works.
