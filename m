I have a similar setup to yours, running on Ubuntu 17.10 Artful.
Symptoms are the same. Did you find out what's wrong with 2.10? (Haven't
tested 2.9 here)

Title:
  (Regression) Memory corruption in Windows 10 guest / amd64

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I have a Win 10 Pro x64 guest inside a qemu/kvm running on an Arch x86_64=
 host. The VM has a physical GPU passed through, as well as the physical US=
B controllers, as well as a dedicated SSD attached via SATA; you can find t=
he complete libvirt xml here: https://pastebin.com/U1ZAXBNg
  I built qemu from source using the qemu-minimal-git AUR package; you can =
find the build script here: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKG=
BUILD?h=3Dqemu-minimal-git (if you aren't familiar with Arch, this is essen=
tially a bash script where build() and package() are run to build the files=
, and then install them into the $pkgdir to later tar them up.)

  Starting with qemu v2.10.0, Windows crashes randomly with a bluescreen
  about CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION. I also tested the git heads
  f90ea7ba7c, 861cd431c9 and e822e81e35, before I went back to v2.9.0,
  which is running stable for over 50 hours right now.

  During my tests I found that locking the memory pages alleviates the
  problem somewhat, but never completely avoids it. However, with the
  crashes occuring randomly, that could as well be false conclusions; I
  had crashes within minutes after boot with that too.

  I will now start `git bisect`ing; if you have any other suggestions on
  what I could try or possible patches feel free to leave them with me.
