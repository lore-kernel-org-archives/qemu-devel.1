The link you added has changed a lot, but due to the feats of git the
following will do for what you initially suggested.

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/61ee6939819963b7845c101485e188ca2a8=

Title:
  fsfreeze-hook script should also ignored dpkg generated files

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello,

  In the fsfreeze-hook script, the following code check if some of the
  files should be ignored:

  =

  # Check whether file $1 is a backup or rpm-generated file and should be i=
gnored
  is_ignored_file() {
      case "$1" in
          *~ | *.bak | *.orig | *.rpmnew | *.rpmorig | *.rpmsave | *.sample)
              return 0 ;;
      esac
      return 1
  }

  The functions should probably also skip dpkg generated files.

  I've found a list of the different extensions in the systemd source
  tree:
