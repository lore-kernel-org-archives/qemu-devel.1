Interestingly, this also affects Microsoft Windows Services For Linux,
i.e. Microsoft's Linux emulation layer.

Title:
  linux-user clone() can't handle glibc posix_spawn() (causes locale-gen
  to assert)

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm running a command (locale-gen) inside of an armv7h chroot mounted
  on my x86_64 desktop by putting qemu-arm-static into /usr/bin/ of the
  chroot file system and I get a core dump.

  locale-gen

360: __spawnix: Assertion `ec >=3D 0' failed.
  qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped

  I've done this same thing successfully for years, but this breakage
  has appeared some time in the last 3 or so months. Possibly with the
  update to qemu version 2.8.
