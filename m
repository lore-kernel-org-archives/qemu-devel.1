Title:
  sgabios outputs incorrect video modes

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in sgabios package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  When run with a bootstrap loader that uses int 0x10 with 0x1301 in
  %ax, incorrect video modes are output to the serial port.  I believe
  the VGA image will be correct.  This might also affect the returned
  values for some interrupts.

  This is caused because the set_cursor_position routine fails to save
  and restore %bx.

  I'm working on a fix for this.
