Public bug reported:

I made the update to 1903, and the HDA device stopped working.

The driver says the device is working correctly, but it does not.
When I try to open the Windows sound configuration, the dialog hangs and ne=
ver shows it's content.

Several people reported this back in May:

https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-v1903-ich6-ich9-virtio/

I can confirm I have exactly the same problem.

Host is Arch Linux, current (5.2.5) kernel, QEMU 4.0.

I enabled HDA debug output and compared an older, working Windows
version to 1903, but could not see the difference. The driver seems to
issue the same verbs.

I am happy to provide additional information if needed.
