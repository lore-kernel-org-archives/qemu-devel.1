Title:
  QEMU 1.4.0 fails to boot sparc64 linux image

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  Hi!

  I tried to boot sparc64 linux image
  (http://packages.debian.org/sid/sparc64/linux-
  image-2.6-sparc64-smp/download) with qemu and received the  error.

  host:~$qemu-system-sparc64 -nographic -kernel vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-sparc64-smp
  OpenBIOS for Sparc64
  Configuration device id QEMU version tion device id QEMUkernel addr n dev=
ice id QEMUkernel cmdline =

  CPUs:  cmdline =

   x SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi
  UUID: 00UltraSPARC-IIi
  Welcome to OpenBIOS v1.0 built on Aug 19 2012 13:06
    Type 'help' for detailed information
  [sparc64] Kernel already loaded

  Also, I tried to follow instruction from Artyom Tarasenko blog
  (http://tyom.blogspot.ru/2012/05/booting-linuxsparc64-on-todays-
  openbios.html), but it's still impossible to boot linux.

  Regards,
  Kirill
