libutil may also missing in other OS.

Title:
  tests/Makefile.include trying to add linking library '-lutil' that
  break the build on Solaris

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Building script 'tests/Makefile.include' contains following code
  ```
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_POSIX),y)
  LIBS +=3D -lutil
  endif
  ```

  library -lutil is not available on Solaris, so the building will failed, =
like
  ```
  ld: fatal: library -lutil: not found
  make: *** [SOMEWHERE/src/qemu-2.12.0/rules.mak:121: qemu-nbd] Error 1
  ```

  Commenting those code out fixed the error.
