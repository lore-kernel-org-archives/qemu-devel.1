I can reproduce it. But there is one interesting thing.
When I replace "-nographic" with "-serial stdio" everything is ok,
icount works normally.

But "-nographic" runs are very slow in icount mode.
It seems that GUI produces some events that force main loop to iterate.

Title:
  -icount increases boot time by >10x

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  When I specify the -icount option, some guest operations such as
  booting a Linux kernel take more than 10 times longer than otherwise.
  For example, the following will boot Aboriginal Linux to the login
  prompt about 6 seconds on my system (using TCG, not KVM):

  wget http://landley.net/aboriginal/downloads/old/binaries/1.4.5/system-im=
age-i686.tar.gz
  gunzip <system-image-i686.tar.gz | tar xfv -
  cd system-image-i686
  sh run-emulator.sh

  If I replace the last line with

  QEMU_EXTRA=3D"-icount shift=3Dauto" sh run-emulator.sh

  booting to the login prompt takes about 1 minute 20 seconds.

  I have tried different values for "shift" other than the "auto" used
  above, but have not been able to find one that gives reasonable
  performance.  Specifying "sleep=3Doff" also did not help.

  During the slow boots, qemu appears to spend most of its time
  sleeping, not using the host CPU.

  I see this with multiple versions of qemu, including current git
  sources (c181ddaa176856b3cd2dfd12bbcf25fa9c884a97), and on multiple
  host OSes, including Debian 9 on x86_64.
