For AArch32 LDREXD and STREXD, architecturally the 32-bit word at the
lowest address is always Rt and the one at addr+4 is Rt2, even if the
CPU is big-endian. Our implementation does these with a single
64-bit store, so if we're big-endian then we need to put the two
32-bit halves together in the opposite order to little-endian,
so that they end up in the right places. We were trying to do
this with the gen_aa32_frob64() function, but that is not correct
for the usermode emulator, because there there is a distinction
between "load a 64 bit value" (which does a BE 64-bit access
and doesn't need swapping) and "load two 32 bit values as one
64 bit access" (where we still need to do the swapping, like
system mode BE32).

This is very much "last thing on Friday", but I'm going to be
travelling next week so thought I'd shove it out for review
and testing. It does fix the test case in the bug. I have
not tested:
 * BE32 system mode
 * BE8
 * little endian :-)

This should probably be cc: stable when it gets through
review and testing.
