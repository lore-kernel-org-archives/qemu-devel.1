Since QEMU 4.0 has been released now, I assume we can close this ticket
as "Fix released"? Or is there still anything left to do here?

Title:
  qemu-img convert is freezing for some DMG files.

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  Recently, I created a file using hdiutil from MacOS (using Zlib
  compression):

  $ hdiutil create -volname MyVolName -srcfolder /path/to/my/vol/ -ov
  -format UDZO myvolname.dmg

  But, when I try to convert this volume using qemu-img convert, this
  command is freezing.

  I'm using the upstream version to test it.

  It is freezing inside the binary search method to retrieve the chunk.

  But, I still don't know why.

  I'm attaching the file as an example.

  It can be mounted using MacOS or other Linux apps like hfsleuth and
  darling-dmg.
