A mount option wouldn't be much use to QEMU -- we can't tell
our users how to mount their filesystems, which they're
often doing lots of other things with besides running QEMU.
(Otherwise we could just tell them "don't use ext4", which
would also solve the problem :-)) We need something we can
use at the individual-syscall level.
