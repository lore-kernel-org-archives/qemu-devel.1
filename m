Title:
  block migration of qcow2 VMs copies all empty space

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  I'm running openstack 2012.1 'icehouse' which, ultimately, calls down
  into qemu-system-x86 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.10.

  I primed the process by copying all necessary base images onto the
  destination host.  Nonetheless, post-migration instances are much
  larger than the original image; the copy duplicated all the empty
  space that ought to have remained copy-on-write.
