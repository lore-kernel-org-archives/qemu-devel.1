The error message is a rather cryptic "LLVM ERROR: 64-bit code requested on=
 a subtarget
that doesn't support it!" as it knows Athlon CPUs don't support the AMD64 I=
SA.

I will relay the tip to the people managing the VMs, I guess this problem w=
ent unnoticed
for so long because there are not many `qemu64` users.

I'm available to test a patch whenever it becomes available, I didn't direc=
tly send one
because I was afraid of breaking the backward compatibility and some (many?=
) VMs.

Title:
  qemu64 CPU model is incorrect

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  At the moment the "qemu64" CPU is defined as follows:

  ```
          .vendor =3D CPUID_VENDOR_AMD,
          .family =3D 6,
          .model =3D 6,
          .stepping =3D 3,
  ```

  According to Wikipedia [1] this means the CPU is defined as part of the
  K7 family while the AMD64 ISA was only introduced with the K8 series!

  This causes some software such as LLVM to notice the problem (32-bit cpu
  with 64-bit capability reported in the cpuid flag) and produce various
  error messages.

  The simple solution would be to upgrade this definition to use the Sledge=
hammer
  family (15) instead. =
