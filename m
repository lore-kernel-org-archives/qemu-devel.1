Title:
  2.10.0 cannot be installed on case-insensitive file system

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  The https://download.qemu.org/qemu-2.10.0.tar.bz2 tarball cannot be
  unpacked on a case-insensitive file system because it has a file
  qemu-2.10.0/roms/u-boot/scripts/Kconfig and a directory
  qemu-2.10.0/roms/u-boot/scripts/kconfig. This prevents installation on
  most macOS systems since by default the file system is case
  insensitive. The 2.10.0 upgrade is blocked in Homebrew due to this
  issue. See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/17467. This
  is a regression from 2.9.0, which didn't have this problem.
