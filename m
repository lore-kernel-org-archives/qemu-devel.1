Title:
  UART in sabrelite machine simulation doesn't work with VxWorks 7

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  The imx_serial.c driver currently implements only partial support for
  the i.MX6 UART hardware. (I understand it's a work in progress and
  that's fine.) dIn particular, it does not implement support for the
  Transmit Complete Interrupt Enable bit in the UCR4 register. The
  VxWorks 7 i.MX6 serial driver depends on the behavior of this bit in
  actual hardware in order to send characters through the UART
  correctly. The result is that with the current machine model, VxWorks
  will boot and run in QEMU but it's unable to print any characters to
  the console serial port.

  I have produced a small patch for the imx_serial.c module to make it
  nominally functional with VxWorks 7. It works well enough to allow the
  boot banner to appear and for the user to interact with the target
  shell.

  I'm not submitting this as a patch to the development list as I'm not
  fully certain it complies with the hardware spec and doesn't break any
  other functionality. I would prefer if the maintainer (or someone)
  reviewed it for any issues/refinements first.

  I'm attaching the patch to this bug report. A copy can also be
  obtained from:

  http://people.freebsd.org/~wpaul/qemu/imx_serial.zip

  This patch was generated against QEMU 2.11.0 but also works with QEMU
  2.11.1.

  My host environment is FreeBSD/amd64 11.1-RELEASE with QEMU
  2.11.0/2.11.11 built from source.
