Title:
  --copy-storage-all failing with qemu 2.10

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  We fixed an issue around disk locking already in regard to qemu-nbd
  [1], but there still seem to be issues.

  $ virsh migrate --live --copy-storage-all kvmguest-artful-normal qemu+ssh=
://10.22.69.196/system
  error: internal error: qemu unexpectedly closed the monitor: 2017-08-18T1=
2:10:29.800397Z qemu-system-x86_64: -chardev pty,id=3Dcharserial0: char dev=
ice redirected to /dev/pts/0 (label charserial0)

  Source libvirt log for the guest:

  Target libvirt log for the guest:

  2017-08-18 12:09:09.010+0000: shutting down, reason=3Dcrashed

  Given the timing it seems that the actual copy now works (it is busy ~10 =
seconds on my environment which would be the copy).
  Also we don't see the old errors we saw before, but afterwards on the act=
ual take-over it fails.

  Dmesg has no related denials as often apparmor is in the mix.

  Need to check libvirt logs of source [2] and target [3] in Detail.
