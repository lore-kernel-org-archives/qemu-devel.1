I assume this has been completely fixed in edk2, so I'm closing this
QEMU bug now.

Title:
  Windows 7 guest won't boot on qemu 2.10 (works on 2.9)

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Qemu version: 2.10 stable.
  Guest: Windows 7 SP1 x64, virtio drivers are already installed in the gue=
st.
  Command line:
  qemu-system-x86_64 \
      -nodefaults \
      -nodefconfig \
      -machine type=3Dq35,accel=3Dkvm \
      -enable-kvm \
      -cpu host \
      -m 2048 \
      -vga virtio \
      -boot menu=3Don \
      -smbios file=3D/path/dmidecode_BIOS.bin \
      -acpitable file=3D/path/acpi_slic.bin \
      -bios /path/OVMF_CODE.fd \
      -net none \
      -drive if=3Dvirtio,media=3Ddisk,file=3D/media/win7.qcow2 \
      -device pcie-root-port \
      -device ich9-usb-ehci1 \
      -device ich9-usb-uhci1 \
      -device ich9-usb-uhci2 \
      -device ich9-usb-uhci3

  Windows hangs at boot with waving flag screen (flag doesn't freeze,
  keeps waving indefinitely). Same command line boots fine with Qemu
  2.9. I tried changing machine type to pc-q35-2.9 - same result.
