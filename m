Public bug reported:

With user mode emulation, messages from genu_log() are emitted
unconditionally to stderr. I didn't find a way to suppress them. It
would be nice to have options similar to the -D/-d options to be able to
filter and/or redirect the output.

My use case is chroot/container execution for different architectures
via binfmt. In this case it will appear as if the binary in question had
emitted messages like "Unsupported setsockopt ..." to stderr while in
fact the message came from qemu-*-static.
