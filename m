So it is likely a wayland <-> SDL thing.
@Desktop Team could you take alook into this - the repro steps in c#2 are p=
retty easy I'd think but none of us would know where in the UI stack to loo=
k for.

Title:
  qemu can't capture keys properly under wayland

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  New
Status in wayland package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  This appears to be different than the previous similar bugs; patches
  do look to be applied to use libinput in the wayland case. Still:

  unknown keycodes `(unnamed)', please report to qemu-devel@nongnu.org

  I am using qemu-system-x86                       1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1
  on artful.

  Many key inputs work correctly, but at boot the system will not
  properly catch the arrow keys, the above error shows up immediately
  after hitting Esc (for instance) to get to the boot menu. Booting from
  CD onto a daily Ubuntu desktop image, I can't navigate the splash
  menu.

  The same works correctly through virt-manager (which uses spice
  AFAICT, but wayland tends to crash when running virt-manager), and
  things work if I switch my session to Xorg rather than wayland.
