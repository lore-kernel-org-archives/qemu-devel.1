Title:
  disk missing in the guest contingently when hotplug several virtio
  scsi disks consecutively

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hi, I found a bug that disk missing (not all disks missing ) in the
  guest contingently when hotplug several virtio scsi disks
  consecutively.  After rebooting the guest,the missing disks appear
  again.

  The guest is centos7.3 running on a centos7.3 host and the scsi
  controllers are configed with iothread.  The scsi controller xml is
  below:

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<controller type=3D'scsi' index=3D'0' model=3D'vi=
rtio-scsi'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<driver iothread=3D'26'/>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<alias name=3D'scsi0'/>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<address type=3D'pci' domain=3D'0x000=
0' bus=3D'0x00' slot=3D'0x07' function=3D'0x0'/>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0</controller>

  If the scsi controllers are configed without iothread,  disks are all
  can be seen in the guest when hotplug several virtio scsi disks
  consecutively.

  I think the biggest difference between them is that scsi controllers
  with iothread call virtio_notify_irqfd to notify guest and scsi
  controllers without iothread call virtio_notify instead.  What make it
  difference? Will interrupts are lost when call virtio_notify_irqfd
  due to  race condition for some unknow reasons? Maybe guys more
  familiar with scsi dataplane can help. Thanks for your reply!
