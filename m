i think was need to be reported

  Test Machines BE 970MP

  if i setup qemu with

  qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display sdl(or gtk),gl=3Don --device virtio-
  gpu-pci,virgl --enable-kvm and so and so

  result is doubled window one is vga other is virtio-gpu-pci without
  any start of the VM . pratically i dont have any output of openbios
  and on the virtual serial output

  the same issue i found is if i select:
  qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display gtk(or sdl) --device virtio-gpu-pci -=
-enable-kvm and so and so

  =

  i had been try to change all the -M types of all kind of pseries without =
any positive result.
