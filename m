This is (IMHO) a bit of an oxymoron, isn't it?  Applications using
the 64-bit API, but storing the value in a 32-bit field?  The same
problem would exist for filesystems with 64-bit inodes or 64-bit
file offsets trying to store these values in 32-bit variables.
It might work most of the time, but it can also break randomly.

It would be relatively straight forward to add a "32bitapi" mount
option to return a 32-bit directory hash to userspace for operations
on that mountpoint (ext4 doesn't have 64-bit inode numbers yet).
However, I can't think of an easy way to do this on a per-process
basis without just having it call the 32-bit API directly.

For ext4 at least, you could just shift the high 32-bit part of
the 64-bit hash down into a 32-bit value in telldir(), and
shift it back up when seekdir() is called.

Cheers, Andreas
