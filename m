dann frazier met the same problem as me in
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1805256).

He said this bugs still persists w/ latest upstream (@ afccfc0). His
reply to me is below:

No, sorry - this bugs still persists w/ latest upstream (@ afccfc0). I
found a report of similar symptoms:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10047341/
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1524770#c13

To be clear, ^ is already fixed upstream, so it is not the *same* issue
- but perhaps related.

Title:
  Qemu-img convert appears to be stuck on aarch64 host with low
  probability

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Hi,  I found a problem that qemu-img convert appears to be stuck on
  aarch64 host with low probability.

  The convert command  line is  "qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw
  disk.qcow2 disk.raw ".

  The bt is below:

  The problem seems to be very similar to the phenomenon described by this =
patch (https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-4.1/src/qemu-kvm-ev/0025-aio_n=
otify-force-main-loop-wakeup-with-SIGIO-aarch64.patch), =


  which force main loop wakeup with SIGIO.  But this patch was reverted
  by the patch (http://ovirt.repo.nfrance.com/src/qemu-kvm-ev/kvm-
  Revert-aio_notify-force-main-loop-wakeup-with-SIGIO-.patch).

  The problem still seems to exist in aarch64 host. The qemu version I used=
 is 2.8.1. The host version is 4.19.28-1.2.108.aarch64.
   Do you have any solutions to fix it?  Thanks for your reply !
