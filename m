Mincore is for monitoring, not cached eviction. And it's not
required to observe cache residency, either. That's a wide open
field containing an uncountable number of moles...

Until you have images (and hence host page cache) shared between
multiple guests. People will want to do this, because it means they
only need a single set of pages in host memory for executable
binaries rather than a set of pages per guest. Then you have
multiple guests being able to detect residency of the same set of
pages. If the guests can then, in any way, control eviction of the
pages from the host cache, then we have a guest-to-guest information
leak channel.

i.e. it's something we need to be aware of and really careful about
enabling infrastructure that /will/ be abused if guests can find a
way to influence the host side cache residency.

Cheers,

Dave.
