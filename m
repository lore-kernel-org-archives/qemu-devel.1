I was thinking that from the device's perspective, both of them are
not persistent until a flush operation is issued (clflush or virtual
flush-interface). But you are right, from the user/software's
perspective, their fundamentals are different.

So for the virtual nvdimm which is backended on normal storage, we
should refuse MAP_SYNC and the only way to guarantee persistence
is fsync/fdatasync.

Actually, we can treat a SPA region which associates with specific
flush interface as special GUID as your proposal, please see more

I am afraid it is not a good idea that a single SPA is used for multiple
purposes. For the region used as "pmem" is directly mapped to the VM so
that guest can freely access it without host's assistance, however, for
the region used as "host communication" is not mapped to VM, so that
it causes VM-exit and host gets the chance to do specific operations,
e.g, flush cache. So we'd better distinctly define these two regions to
avoid the unnecessary complexity in hypervisor.
