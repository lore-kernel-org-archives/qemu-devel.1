Ok, I taught that could be an issue, but as I said, I don't really know
all the internals of QEMU.

Another idea would be to fork the child, without CLONE_VM, on the
initial call to the clone syscall, like it's done right now, and then
wait for that child until he call execve or exit syscall.  Maybe using
some shared memory or IPC to pass the relevant status when the child
finally invoke those syscalls.

When the child finally call one of those, then after signalling the
parent about where it is (and the params to the syscall), the child
could exit and the parent actually take action.

Regards,
Eric

Title:
  linux-user clone() can't handle glibc posix_spawn() (causes locale-gen
  to assert)

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm running a command (locale-gen) inside of an armv7h chroot mounted
  on my x86_64 desktop by putting qemu-arm-static into /usr/bin/ of the
  chroot file system and I get a core dump.

  I've done this same thing successfully for years, but this breakage
  has appeared some time in the last 3 or so months. Possibly with the
  update to qemu version 2.8.
