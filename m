Title:
  armeb regression since qemu version 2.8

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I have noticed a regression when I upgraded from qemu-armeb 2.7 to
  2.8, and the problem is still present with version 2.10.1.

  I am using qemu for GCC validation, noticed problems with testcases
  involving atomics, I'm attaching here atomic-exchange-4.exe.

  # with 2.7:
  $ qemu-armeb -cpu any -R 0 -L $PWD -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=3D$PWD/lib $PWD/ato=
mic-exchange-4.exe
  $ echo $?
  0
  # with 2.8, 2.10.1:
  $ qemu-armeb -cpu any -R 0 -L $PWD -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=3D$PWD/lib $PWD/ato=
mic-exchange-4.exe
  qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
  Aborted (core dumped)
  $ echo $?
  134

  The source code is gcc/testsuite/gcc.dg/atomic-exchange-4.c

  Running with -d in_asm shows a difference early in the startup code:
  IN: _dl_sysdep_start
  [...]
  0x40a17790:  908ff103      addls	pc, pc, r3, lsl #2

  and then the next address is not the same with qemu 2.7 and 2.10.1

  I hope you have enough data/information to reproduce and confirm/fix
  the problem.

  Thanks
