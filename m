-vga virtio is working, I finally figured out my image was corrupted, I
realized you have to be careful shutting the guest down correctly, or
you could corrupt the image/system...

So now, back to the same issue, even using 2.8.0 and virtio the grub
splash doesn't always appears.

So this is random, one time I start the Guest, the boot splash appears,
the next time I start the guest it doesn't...

Grub boot splash doesn't appear consistent...

It's the same with std too...

Title:
  Ubuntu 16.04.1 Grub Splash Doesn't Appear

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  My Specs:

  Slackware 14.2 x86_64 > Host
  QEMU 2.7.0

  Ubuntu 16.04.1 x86_64 > Guest

  Start options for Ubuntu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=3Draw,file=3Dubuntu.img \
  -cpu host \
  --enable-kvm \
  -smp 2 \
  -m 4096 \
  -vga vmware \
  -soundhw ac97 \
  -usbdevice tablet \
  -rtc base=3Dlocaltime \
  -usbdevice host:0781:5575

  I've started Ubuntu around 6-8 times, and I have only see the Grub
  Boot Splash appear twice, so pretty much without fail it typically
  boots past the grub splash and automatically boots...

  These are the /etc/default/grub settings; (I only changed these
  options GRUB_TIMEOUT=3D15 and GRUB_GFXMODE=3D1440x900)

  # If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
  # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.
  # For full documentation of the options in this file, see:
  #   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'

  GRUB_DEFAULT=3D0
  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=3D0
  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=3Dtrue
  GRUB_TIMEOUT=3D15
  GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=3D`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=3D"quiet splash"
