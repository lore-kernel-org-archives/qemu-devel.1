I've also had the exact symptoms and issues you've described. I have
also noticed that the VM would BSOD with the
CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION message when the host system would read VM
memory from swap.

After disabling swap on the host system I've completely managed to
eliminate this BSOD issue. Hopefully it's also applicable to your system
so you can atleast figure out how to move forward.

Title:
  Memory corruption in Windows 10 guest / amd64

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I have a Win 10 Pro x64 guest inside a qemu/kvm running on an Arch x86_64=
 host. The VM has a physical GPU passed through, as well as the physical US=
B controllers, as well as a dedicated SSD attached via SATA; you can find t=
he complete libvirt xml here: https://pastebin.com/U1ZAXBNg
  I built qemu from source using the qemu-minimal-git AUR package; you can =
find the build script here: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKG=
BUILD?h=3Dqemu-minimal-git (if you aren't familiar with Arch, this is essen=
tially a bash script where build() and package() are run to build the files=
, and then install them into the $pkgdir to later tar them up.)

  Starting with qemu v2.10.0, Windows crashes randomly with a bluescreen
  about CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION. I also tested the git heads
  f90ea7ba7c, 861cd431c9 and e822e81e35, before I went back to v2.9.0,
  which is running stable for over 50 hours right now.

  During my tests I found that locking the memory pages alleviates the
  problem somewhat, but never completely avoids it. However, with the
  crashes occuring randomly, that could as well be false conclusions; I
  had crashes within minutes after boot with that too.

  I will now start `git bisect`ing; if you have any other suggestions on
  what I could try or possible patches feel free to leave them with me.
