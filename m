Hi Jason,

this is how i trigger the bug:
- on the guest, tcpdump on on the interface
- on the guest, run iperf against the host
- on the guest, cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
- on the guest, run one or two instances of xdp_ttl compiled with DEBUG 
uncommented, that i start stop, until i trigger the bug.

qemu command line is as follow:

qemu-system-x86_64 -name ubuntu --enable-kvm -machine pc,accel=kvm -smp 
2 -drive file=/dev/LocalDisk/ubuntu,if=virtio,format=raw -m 2048 -rtc 
base=localtime,clock=host -usbdevice tablet --balloon virtio -netdev 
tap,id=ubuntu-0,ifname=ubuntu-0,script=/home/jenfi/WORK/jp/qemu/if-up,downscript=/home/jenfi/WORK/jp/qemu/if-down,vhost=on,queues=4 
-device 
virtio-net-pci,netdev=ubuntu-0,mac=de:ad:be:ef:01:03,mq=on,guest_tso4=off,guest_tso6=off,guest_ecn=off,guest_ufo=off,vectors=2 
-vnc 127.0.0.1:3 -nographic -serial 
file:/home/jenfi/WORK/jp/qemu/ubuntu.out -monitor 
unix:/home/jenfi/WORK/jp/qemu/ubuntu.sock,server,nowait

Notice, the smp 2, queues to 4 and vectors to 2.
Seem that if fogot to mention that in the beginning of this thread, 
sorry for that.

Best regards.

Jean-Philippe
