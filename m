Well, it appeared that it is not enough to set "disable-modern=3Don" for
virtio-blk-pci devices. You have to do the same for virtio-scsi-pci, and
may be for other virtio devices you are using to disable virtio 1.0. But
VM will hangs latter on during boot process if you use virtio-rng-pci.

"-machine accel=3Dtcg" will work but in cost of performance penalty due to
software virtualization.

So I found "-machine type=3Dpc-i440fx-x" where x <=3D 2.6 the only reliable
workaround.

Title:
  qemu-kvm 2.7 does not boot kvm VMs with virtio on top of VMware ESX

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  After todays Proxmox update all my Linux VMs stopped booting.

  # How to reproduce
  - Have KVM on top of VMware ESX (I use VMware ESX 6)
  - Boot Linux VM with virtio Disk drive.

  =

  # Result
  virtio based VMs do not boot anymore:

  root@demotuxdc:/etc/pve/nodes/demotuxdc/qemu-server# grep virtio0 100.con=
f =

  bootdisk: virtio0
  virtio0: pvestorage:100/vm-100-disk-1.raw,discard=3Don,size=3D20G

  (initially with cache=3Dwritethrough, but that doesn=C2=B4t matter)

  What happens instead is:

  - BIOS displays "Booting from harddisk..."
  - kvm process of VM loops at about 140% of Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6260U CPU=
 @ 1.80GHz Skylake dual core CPU

  Disk of course has valid bootsector:

  root@demotuxdc:/srv/pvestorage/images/100# file -sk vm-100-disk-1.raw =

  vm-100-disk-1.raw: DOS/MBR boot sector DOS/MBR boot sector DOS executable=
 (COM), boot code
  root@demotuxdc:/srv/pvestorage/images/100# head -c 2048 vm-100-disk-1.raw=
 | hd | grep GRUB
  00000170  be 94 7d e8 2e 00 cd 18  eb fe 47 52 55 42 20 00  |..}.......GR=
UB .|

  =

  # Workaround 1
  - Change disk from virtio0 to scsi0
  - Debian boots out of the box after this change
  - SLES 12 needs a rebuilt initrd
  - CentOS 7 too, but it seems that is not even enough and it still fails (=
even in hostonly=3D"no" mode for dracut)

  =

  # Workaround 2
  Downgrade pve-qemu-kvm 2.7.0-3 to 2.6.2-2.

  =

  # Expected results
  Disk boots just fine via virtio like it did before.

  =

  # Downstream bug report
  Downstream suggests an issue with upstream qemu-kvm:
